        One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers sat
        over their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay, watching
        the grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney. Their
        names were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by
        trade, and were noted as possessing thoughtful minds and a deep interest
        in all scientific knowledge and new discovery. Before that night—a
        memorable night, as it was to prove—hundreds of millions of people had
        watched the rising smoke-wreaths of their fires without drawing any
        special inspiration from the fact.
